## My process

### Built with

- React
- Styled-components

### What I learned

My focus by doing this challenge was to learn and actually use styled-components library for React. But I learned how to do theme switching from this challenge too.

### Useful resources

- I read [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/dark-mode-react-apps-styled-components/) and [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/create-a-dark-mode-of-your-app-using-styled-components-a44bc5a59330) before working on this challenge. It was really useful for me who has just started using styled-components.
